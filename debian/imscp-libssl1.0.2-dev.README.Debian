OpenSSL development libraries for i-MSCP PhpSwitcher Plugin
-----------------------------------------------------------

This package provides older 1.0.x OpenSSL development libraries and header
files as required by the i-MSCP PhpSwitcher plug-in for building PHP versions
that are not compatible with newest >= 1.1.x OpenSSL versions.

The files provided by this package don't replace nor conflict with those
provided by the operating system as they are installed under the /opt
hierarchy.
